# The Neighborhoods of Hamburg and Munich**  


**Introduction**

For this capstone project, we compare the second and third most populous German cities Hamburg and Munich with a population of roughly 1.7 million and 1.3 million people respectively. The neighborhoods of these two citites are analysed to find how similar/different the cities are, using the location data obtained from Foursquare's API. After a general comparison, this project dwells into a business problem of choosing the best city among these two for opening a restaurant.

**Business problem**

A famous Indian restaurant in Berlin after being a major hit in the country's capital city is looking to open a new franchise in another German city. For the location of this venture they are considering the next two most populous cities in the country, Hamburg and Munich. 

Leveraging the neighborhood data from Foursquare's API, this project focuses on finding the most suited location among the two cities for opening the new restaurant. 

**Who can use this data?**

Since a general comparison of neighborhoods of these cities are made in this analysis, potential users who can utilize  the data from this project are aplenty. 

 1. Tourists who are visiting either of the city for the first time can find a likable neighborhood for their stay
 
 2. Entrepreneurs who are looking to setup new businesses of various kinds (coffee shops, restaurants, gym, etc) can choose the most suited location
